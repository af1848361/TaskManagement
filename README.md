Read Tasks: View all your tasks in a list.
Update Tasks: Modify existing tasks as needed.

Getting Started
Note: Before proceeding, ensure you have completed the React Native - Environment Setup instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server
First, you need to start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that comes with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

bash

Run
Copy code
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
Step 2: Start Your Application
Let the Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project and run the following command to start your app on either Android or iOS:

For Android
bash

Run
Copy code
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
For iOS
bash

Run
Copy code
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

You can also run the app directly from within Android Studio or Xcode.

Step 3: Modifying Your App
Now that you have successfully run the app, you can start modifying it.

Open App.tsx in your preferred text editor and make some changes.

For Android: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS) to see your changes!

For iOS: Hit <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and view your changes!
